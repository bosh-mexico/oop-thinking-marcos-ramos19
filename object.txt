1. Core Classes and Their Responsibilities 
Single Responsibilities Principle    
    1.1 Vehicle Speed Governor (VSG)
    Central class that coordinates all VSG operations. It does not perform tasks itself but delegates to other objects.

        * Responsibilities:
            - Manage the VSG lifecycle
            - Perform system health checks 
            - Evaluate current speed and decide on control actions
            - Manage system state (active, inactive, failsafe)
            - Delegate interaction with sensors, actuators, alerts and logging

    1.2. Interfaces
    Abstract definitions that specify "what" a component must do, not "how". This allows for flexible swapping of implementations.

    1.3. Concrete implementations
    Classes that implement the interfaces, providing the actual or simulated logic for each component.
